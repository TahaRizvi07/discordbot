# discordbot
Repository for version control of Taha's Discord bot, Bot-san.  

Hi! My name is Taha. I'm a recent graduate from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, with a B.A. in Computer Science.

This bot is just a little side project I thought I'd undertake over the summer to explore and learn more about Python as well as APIs and Discord bots. Python was my first programming language, and it's my favorite. I've also studied Java, C, and C++. 

Hope you enjoy!
